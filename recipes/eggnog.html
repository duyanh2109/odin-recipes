    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This eggnog recipe for thick, creamy, and sweet eggnog with just the right amount of spice took me several years to perfect. Now everyone asks, "When are you making your eggnog?" In this homemade eggnog recipe, the egg yolks are tempered for safety, and you can adjust the amount of rum to taste, or leave it out entirely so the whole family can enjoy this rich holiday treat. It's a bit of work to make, but well worth it, especially when your holiday guests are so impressed. Learn how to make eggnog at home and you'll never serve store-bought eggnog again!</p>
